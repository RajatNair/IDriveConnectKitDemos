# IDriveConnectKit Demos

Demonstration apps to show off some of the fun possibilities available with the IDrive system.
Currently they require the BMW or Mini Connected app installed. The Classic app should work too.
The demos require a BMW Connected Ready app installed on the phone, such as Spotify or iHeartRadio.
This provides the cert that is used to log in to the car.
